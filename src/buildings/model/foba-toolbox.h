/**
 * @brief Assess if the 3D straight line between two points intersect a building.
 *
 * This class provide an optimization tools to make quick decision on Line of
 * Sight (LoS) between two point and a given building, to find the corner of building that causes
 * diffraction and to get the point where the secular reflection occures between two point and a
 * surface.
 *
 * The term quick decision refers to the method where nodes are attributed "zones" relative to there
 * position to buildings and based on combined zones. They may be in LOS by definition and would not
 * need the computation of the linear function and to check if this line intersect the building. In
 * short, this method is able to affirm that nodes are in LOS using only comparators (<,>,>=,<=),
 * but if they are in NLOS, their is an abiguity that is lifted by the computation of the line
 * between the nodes and it's intersection with the building.
