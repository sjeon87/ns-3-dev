 * @defgroup traffic TrafficGenerator
 *
 * This traffic generator class implements the main traffic generates logic. Different
 * generators differ in the probabilistic distributions they use to calculate the
 * traffic properties. These include the next packet generation time, the next packet size, or
 * the burst size (if the generator sends the packet burst).
 * Each traffic generator specialization is expected to override StartApplication() function in
 * which it should be initialized the traffic generation according to the desired model.
 * Also, for some traffic generator models, the burst size should be expressed in the number of
 * packets because the packet size is generated each time randomly, as for example is the case with
 * TrafficGeneratorNgmnVideo. Otherwise, the packet burst can simply be expressed as the number of
 * bytes.
