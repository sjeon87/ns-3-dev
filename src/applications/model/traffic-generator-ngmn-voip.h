/**
 * This class implements a traffic generator for the VoIP traffic.
 * Follows the traffic model for VOIP described in the Annex B of
 * White Paper by the NGMN Alliance.
 *
 * Basically, according to the NGMN document, the VOIP traffic can be
 * modeled as a simple 2-state voice activity model. The states are:
 *      - Inactive State
 *      - Active State
 *
 * In the model, the probability of transitioning from state 1 (the active
 * speech state) to state 0 (the inactive or silent state) is equal to "a",
 * while the probability of transitioning from state 0 to
 * state 1 is "c".
 * The model is updated at the speech encoder frame rate R=1/T,
 * where T is the encoder frame duration (typically, 20ms).
 *
 * A 2-state model is extremely simplistic, and many more complex
 * models are available. However, it is amenable to rapid analysis and
 * initial estimation of talk spurt arrival statistics and hence reservation activity.
 * The main purpose of this traffic model is not to favour any codec but to specify a
 * model to obtain results which are comparable.
